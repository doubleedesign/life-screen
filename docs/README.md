# LifeScreen docs

A standalone Vue + TypeScript + Vite app for, well, the docs.

The first Vue 3 app I have built, and I didn't have much experience with Vue 2. Some components use the Options API and some use Composition, which I assume isn't great (pick one!) but hey, it's a learning exercise ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
